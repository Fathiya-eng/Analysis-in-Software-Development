2. Product Backlog Development
2.1 What Is a Product Backlog?

A product backlog is a priority-ordered list of all work items the software needs, including:

Features

Enhancements

Bug fixes

Technical tasks

Research (spikes)

It represents the single source of truth for the development team.

2.2 How to Create a Product Backlog
Step 1: Collect Requirements

Gather all functional and non-functional requirements.

Step 2: Break Requirements into Product Backlog Items

Each backlog item should be:

Short

Describable

Testable

Step 3: Prioritize the Backlog

Assign importance based on:

Business value

Urgency

Dependencies

Step 4: Estimate Workload

Use story points or time estimates.

2.3 Backlog Prioritization Techniques

MoSCoW: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have

Value vs. Effort matrix

Risk-based prioritization

Kano model

Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)

2.4 Backlog Refinement

Also called backlog grooming.
Occurs every sprint to:

Add new items

Re-estimate tasks

Split large stories

Remove unnecessary items

Correct priorities

Backlog refinement keeps development efficient and predictable.
