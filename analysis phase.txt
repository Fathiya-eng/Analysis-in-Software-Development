1. The Analysis Phase in Software Development

1.1 Definition of the Analysis Phase

The Analysis Phase is a critical stage within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where project requirements are investigated, documented, validated, and transformed into clear, actionable specifications.
Its main goal is to understand what the system must do before designing how it will be built.

1.2 Importance of the Analysis Phase

Prevents misunderstandings and incorrect development

Reduces project risks and delays

Ensures the solution meets business needs

Creates a clear foundation for design, development, and testing

Helps estimate budget, timeline, and resources accurately

A system built without proper analysis often results in rework, cost overruns, and user dissatisfaction.

1.3 Sub-Steps of the Analysis Phase
1. Requirements Elicitation

Collecting information from stakeholders using:

Interviews

Surveys

Observation

Document analysis

Workshops / JAD sessions

2. Requirements Analysis & Classification

Organizing requirements into types:

Functional requirements → System behaviors

Non-functional requirements → Performance, security, usability

Business rules

Constraints

3. Modeling & Diagramming

Creating visual representations such as:

Use Case Diagrams

Activity Diagrams

Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)

These help clarify processes and data relationships.

4. Requirements Documentation

All collected requirements are documented in:

Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

User Requirements Document (URD)

5. Requirements Validation

Ensuring requirements are:

Complete

Clear

Testable

Feasible

Approved by stakeholders

Validation techniques:

Prototyping

Reviews & walkthroughs

Acceptance from business users

1.4 Deliverables of the Analysis Phase

Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Use case models

Process diagrams

Data models (ERD)

User stories (Agile)

Business rules documentation

Non-functional requirements list

1.5 Best Practices

Engage stakeholders early

Use visual diagrams for clarity

Validate requirements frequently

Avoid ambiguous language

Keep documentation updated

Maintain good communication between business & technical teams

1.6 Common Challenges

Miscommunication between stakeholders

Changing requirements

Unclear or conflicting requirements

Lack of stakeholder availability

Over- or under-documenting requirements
