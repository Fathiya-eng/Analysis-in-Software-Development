Main Activities in the Analysis Phase: 
| Activity                  | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Requirement Gathering** | Meeting users, interviews, surveys, collecting all needs        |
| **Requirements Analysis** | Checking requirements for clarity, consistency, and feasibility |
| **Process Modeling**      | Creating diagrams (DFD, UML use cases) to visualize workflows   |
| **Defining Requirements** | Writing *Functional* and *Non-functional* Requirements          |
| **Documentation**         | Creating the **SRS (Software Requirements Specification)**      |

Why the Analysis Phase Is Important?
| Benefit                      | Explanation                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity**                  | Ensures developers fully understand what to build |
| **Prevents Rework**          | Fixing mistakes later is 10x more expensive       |
| **Improves Planning**        | Helps estimate time and cost accurately           |
| **Better User Satisfaction** | Because real needs are captured                   |
