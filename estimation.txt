4. Weighting and Estimation

4.1 Story Point Estimation Techniques

Story points measure:

Complexity

Effort

Risk

Common scales:

Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…)

T-shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL)

Power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8…)

4.2 Planning Poker

A collaborative estimation technique:

Team reads a user story

Each member picks a card representing story points

All cards are revealed at once

Discussion happens if estimates differ

Final estimate agreed

4.3 T-Shirt Sizing

Used for early estimation when details are incomplete:

XS

S

M

L

XL

Maps later to story points.

4.4 Weighting by Complexity, Priority & Business Value

Each story is scored based on:

Technical complexity

Business value

Risk
